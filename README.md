# Predictive-Data-Mining-Transfer-Learning

Predictive data mining is data mining that is done for the purpose of using business intelligence or other data to forecast or predict trends. 
This type of data mining can help business leaders make better decisions and can add value to the efforts of the analytics team.

The purpose of this project, is to use predictive data mining techniques in order to determine if an individual has pneumonia.

We used Transfer Learning to implemen this work.

Our dataset contains chest X-ray images. 
There are three types of images in the dataset:
Normal
Bacterial Pneumonia
Viral Pneumonia

Among many tranfer learninig techniques, we used VGG-16, VGG-19 and ResNet.
